Herbalist and owner of Moss's Herbs and Tinctures.

### DM Notes 

Greta sold herbs to various villagers over the last week. 

She partakes in some illicit trading. 

After seeing the full set of different ingredients she sold, she realized it would be a powerful sleep draught and worries about being accused. Thus, her demeanor is secretive. 

**Secrets** 
- Ledger contains evidence she sold the sleeping ingredients.
