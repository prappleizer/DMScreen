### DM Notes

Cawley was approached by the shapeshifter, offered money to allow them to experiment on the townsfolk. While a little greedy, he felt threatened by the shapeshifter and after obtaining a promise that no villagers would die, he agreed, hoping to use the money to help the village. 

**Phases of Behavior** 

1. At the beginning, Edwin is helpful and grateful for the help, playing along.
2. As the players get closer to the truth, he grows less helpful, becoming nervous and deflective.
3. *If* a serious accusation is raised against Elara or Greta, he moves to have them banished or killed immediately, somewhat suspiciously.
4. If heavily threatened, reveals the secret. 
5. If he finds his note has been stolen, he raises the townsguard against the party.
