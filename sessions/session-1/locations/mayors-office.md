title: Mayor Cawley's Office
---


The office is a small, cluttered space in a small building off the village square. 
Cawley will meet the party here to explain the situation initially. 

**Investigation** 

- DC 10: You see signs that the Mayor is nervous about something; his materials are haphazardly scattered, he's left candles burning down to the stump, there are scratch marks on the side of the table where he sits. 

- DC 15: In his desk drawer, you find a note with a scribbled summons into the nearby woods for a "deal".
