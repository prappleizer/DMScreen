Haver's Rest is a modest farming village in the Borderlands of Ninyasu. Recently, several villagers have succumbed to an unexplained sleep from which they cannot be awakened. Unbeknownst to most residents, the village mayor, **Edwin Cawley**, has struck a deal with a shapeshifting agent of the Nightmare Lord. Tempted by promises of wealth (which he intends to use to improve the village), Edwin agreed to allow the shapeshifter to conduct its "experiment," believing no lasting harm would come to his people.

The shapeshifter has been impersonating various villagers, administering a potent poison laced with Dreamstone essence to induce comas. The Dreamstone, hidden in a cave in the nearby woods, amplifies the villagers' nightmares, causing them to manifest in reality. As the nightmare creatures attack and put more villagers to sleep, the affliction threatens to engulf the entire village.

### **Arrival at Haver's Rest**

As the party approaches Haver's Rest, read or paraphrase:

_The village of Haver's Rest lies peacefully among rolling hills and golden fields. Yet, an undercurrent of unease permeates the air. Villagers move about with weary expressions, and hushed conversations cease as you pass by. A sense of anticipation—or perhaps dread—seems to hang over the community._
