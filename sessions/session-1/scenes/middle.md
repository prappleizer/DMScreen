*The office of the mayor is messy and disheveled, with papers, ledgers, and books strewn and stacked about, candles burning low, and no sign of recent cleaning*.


- Edwin greets the party thankfully, happy to have someone coming to investigate. He explains that starting around a week ago, villagers began falling into deep slumber from which they could not be awoken. 
- His town doctor was stumped; they appear to still be dreaming/having eye movement, but can't seem to be woken. Many villagers grew scared and left, at least till this blows over, and the villages output has ground to a halt. 
- He provides a list of a few of the sleeping villagers whose families have said it's okay to poke around: 
    - Thorin Stonebrook, the blacksmith. 
    - Lena Fairwind, a farmer's wife. 
    - Eldon Weaver, the town bard.
    - Marina Elia, a hunter who often stops in town.
    - Gregor Hiltofl, the Miller.
